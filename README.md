# Alternative Language project 
Report
1.	 C# 7.0
2.	I chose C# since it was the closest language to what I had previously known so I could work better with it and be able to learn a better understanding of both at the same time.  
3.	  For starters C# fully supports object-oriented programming paradigms, including classes, objects which was vital In this project. 
The File ingestion was standard using Read/Write line, but creating a method to properly read through the file was a bit difficult to properly implement.
 Assignment statements in C# are straightforward and follow the conventional syntax (Variable = Value). 
C# supports defining functions/ methods using the void keyword for methods that don't return a value, they also allow for parameter to allow flexibility and reusability.
For exception handling C# contain various tools, such as try, catch, finally, and throw keywords.

o	System.IO: This library provides classes and methods for performing input and output operations in C#. It includes classes like StreamReader and StreamWriter for reading from and writing to files, which was used in the ReadCSV method to read data from a CSV file.
o	System.Linq: This library provides language-integrated query (LINQ) capabilities in C#. It includes extension methods for querying data collections, such as Select, Distinct, and ToList, which was used in the UniqueValues method to perform operations on lists of Cell objects. 
o	System.Collections.Generic: This library provides generic collection classes in C#, such as List<T>, Dictionary<TKey, TValue>, etc. I HAD used List<T> extensively in your code to store and manipulate collections of Cell objects.
